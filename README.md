## Neonatal Monitoring System for Prevention of Swapping of Babies

---

### Project Descripttion

> **A neonatal monitoring system is a type of medical device that is used to monitor the vital signs and other important parameters of newborn babies. These systems typically consist of sensors that are attached to the baby's body, as well as a monitoring unit that displays the collected data.
One of the key benefits of using a neonatal monitoring system is its ability to reduce the risk of baby swapping. This is a serious problem that can occur in healthcare settings, where infants may be incorrectly identified or exchanged. This can have disastrous consequences, as it can lead to babies receiving the wrong medical treatment or being given to the wrong parents. By using a neonatal monitoring system, healthcare providers can ensure that each baby is properly identified and tracked, reducing the chances of a mistake being made.
In addition to helping to prevent baby swapping, neonatal monitoring systems can also assist healthcare providers in identifying and addressing potential health concerns. The real-time data that these systems provide can alert healthcare providers to any changes in the baby's vital signs, allowing them to take prompt action if necessary. This can help to prevent medical complications and improve the overall quality of care that newborn babies receive.**
